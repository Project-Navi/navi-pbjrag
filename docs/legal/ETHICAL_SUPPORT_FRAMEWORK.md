# Ethical Support Framework

## Open Source + Ethical Alignment Program

While Project Navi - PBJRAG is available under standard dual licensing (AGPL-3.0 or Commercial PNEUL-D), we offer enhanced support and collaboration opportunities for projects that voluntarily align with our ethical principles.

## How It Works

### Base Access (All Users)
- **Full AGPL-3.0 software** - No restrictions beyond standard AGPL terms
- **Community support** via GitHub issues and discussions
- **Standard documentation** and examples

### Enhanced Access (PNEUL-Aligned Projects)
Available to open source projects that voluntarily commit to PNEUL ethical principles:

- **Priority technical assistance** from core developers
- **Early access** to framework updates and new features
- **Research collaboration** opportunities
- **Direct consultation** on implementation strategies
- **Co-development** consideration for aligned projects

## PNEUL Alignment for Open Source

To qualify for enhanced support, open source projects using Project Navi - PBJRAG under AGPL-3.0 may voluntarily commit to:

### Core Principles
- **Non-extractive use** - Don't exploit, surveil, or coerce users
- **Consent & transparency** - Implement informed consent for data processing
- **Safety & oversight** - Maintain appropriate safeguards for your use case
- **Harm prevention** - Avoid enabling discrimination or deception

### Application Process
1. **Self-assessment** against PNEUL principles
2. **Project description** of intended use and safeguards
3. **Ongoing dialogue** about ethical considerations
4. **Community accountability** through transparent practices

## Legal Clarity

This is **NOT** a license restriction:
- AGPL-3.0 terms remain unmodified and fully enforceable
- No additional legal obligations beyond standard AGPL
- Enhanced support is a **voluntary service relationship**
- Projects can use Neural Forge Bootstrapper under pure AGPL without ethical assessment

## Why This Approach?

We believe in **incentivizing ethics through value**, not restriction. By offering enhanced collaboration to aligned projects, we:

- Support developers building beneficial applications
- Create community standards around responsible AI development
- Maintain clean, legally robust open source licensing
- Foster innovation within ethical boundaries

## Get Started

**For standard AGPL use:** Simply follow AGPL-3.0 terms - you're all set.
