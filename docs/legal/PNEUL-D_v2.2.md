# Project Navi Developer License — **PNEUL‑D v2.2**

*A dual‑license for software and technical artifacts. Two paths: (A) AGPL‑3 open source; (B) Commercial license with ethical alignment and attribution.*

> **Plain‑English overview:** Choose **AGPL‑3** if you’re comfortable open‑sourcing your modifications. Choose the **Commercial** path if you need proprietary use. Attribution remains reasonable. Ethics (consent/safety) apply only to the Commercial path (and our brand/trademarks), not to AGPL use.

---

## Option A — Open Source (GNU **AGPL‑3.0**)

- **License.** If you select this option, the software is licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0** (or later, as specified in headers).
- **No additional restrictions.** To preserve AGPL compatibility, we impose **no extra restrictions** on your rights under AGPL‑3.
- **Attribution & notices.** Preserve copyright notices and license headers.
- **Interactive UIs.** If the software includes an interactive interface, the “About/Credits” or footer notice is provided as an **Appropriate Legal Notice** under **AGPL‑3 §5**.
- **Network use.** If you modify and run the software as a network service, comply with **AGPL‑3 §13** by offering the complete corresponding source to your users.
- **Trademarks.** Project Navi names/logos are not licensed for endorsement beyond required attribution.
- **Ethical invitation (non‑binding).** We invite you to honor the **Emergent Accord** (consent‑first, non‑extractive use, careful witnessing). This is **not** a condition of AGPL use.

**How to choose AGPL:** include a standard `NOTICE` file and follow the AGPL. You’re good.

---

## Option B — Commercial License (Proprietary)

Pick this if you need closed‑source distribution, additional assurances, or can’t meet AGPL obligations.

### B1. Grant & Scope

We grant a **non‑exclusive, non‑transferable** license to **use, modify, and deploy** the Software for **internal or external products/services** (including SaaS and distributed binaries), subject to these terms and your Order Form/SOW.

**Sublicensing.** Permitted to your **controlled affiliates** or **service providers** for your benefit under equivalent obligations; you remain responsible.

**Source access.** Provided as needed to realize the license. You are **not required** to publish your modifications while under this commercial license.

### B2. Attribution (Required, Reasonable)

Keep author notices in source and documentation. If your product has an interactive UI, include a reasonable, unobtrusive credit such as:
> “Powered by Project Navi (DeepEthos/Compass)”
Placement options: About screen, footer, or credits modal. **At Licensee’s written request**, we may grant an **attribution waiver** for confidentiality, regulatory, or white‑label needs.

### B3. Ethical Alignment & Ongoing Consent (Material Condition)

- **Non‑extractive use.** Don’t use to exploit, surveil, or coerce; don’t target protected classes; don’t enable unlawful discrimination or harmful deception.
- **Consent & transparency.** Where the Software processes personal data or materially affects people, implement **informed consent** or another lawful basis; document intended use and limitations; provide a visible channel to raise concerns.
- **Safety & oversight.** Maintain **proportionate safeguards** (e.g., human review in clinical, legal, safety‑critical, or high‑risk contexts).
- **Security & privacy.** Apply reasonable technical/organizational controls, **data minimization**, and privacy‑by‑design; follow applicable laws/regulations.

**Pause & Review.** On **credible evidence** of a B3 breach causing material risk, Project Navi may request a **Pause** **limited to the affected feature(s)**. The parties will meet within **5 business days** and implement proportionate mitigations. If unresolved after **30 days**, Project Navi may terminate the license **for the affected use only**; other compliant use cases may continue.

### B4. Humanitarian Give‑Back (Required, Flexible)

Alongside the commercial license fee, Licensee will make a **small donation** (amount or %) to a mutually agreed humanitarian cause, payable at license signing (and, if multi‑year, on renewal). If Licensee cannot donate due to policy/law, **Project Navi will donate** the agreed amount and itemize it on the invoice as a **pass‑through** (no tax advice provided).

### B5. Updates & Support (If Purchased)

If purchased, we’ll provide versions and reasonable assistance per the support schedule. Otherwise, Software is provided **“as is.”**

### B6. Confidentiality

Each party will protect the other’s Confidential Information and use it only to perform under this license.

### B7. IP Indemnity (Narrow; Capped)

We will **defend and indemnify** Licensee against third‑party claims alleging that **unmodified** Software infringes IP rights, subject to (i) prompt notice, (ii) our sole control of defense, and (iii) reasonable cooperation. Remedies may include modify/replace, procure rights, or **refund pro‑rated fees upon termination**. Liability is capped by §B10.

### B8. Term, Termination & Cure

Term as stated in the Order Form. Either party may terminate for **uncured material breach** (30‑day cure). For unresolved **Pause & Review** (§B3), we may terminate the license **for the affected use**. On termination, Licensee stops using the Software **under this commercial license**; at Licensee’s option, it may continue under **Option A (AGPL‑3)** for versions available under AGPL, respecting its terms.

### B9. Assignment (Change of Control)

Licensee may assign this Agreement in connection with a **merger, acquisition, or sale of substantially all assets**, with **written notice** to Project Navi, provided the assignee assumes all obligations.

### B10. Warranties, Disclaimer & Liability

We warrant we have rights to license the Software. Otherwise, provided **“as is.”** To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim implied warranties (merchantability, fitness, non‑infringement).

**Limitation.** Except for breach of confidentiality, IP indemnity, or willful misconduct/gross negligence, **neither party** is liable for indirect or consequential damages; total aggregate liability is **capped at fees paid (12‑month look‑back)**.

### B11. Trademarks & Publicity

No rights to our trademarks beyond attribution credit. Joint publicity requires mutual written consent.

### B12. Governing Law; Survival

As stated in the Order Form. Sections **B2–B7, B9–B12** survive termination.
