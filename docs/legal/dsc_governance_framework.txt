# DSC Ethical Governance Framework
## The Stewardship Covenant for Differential Symbolic Calculus

*Version 1.0 - Governing Document for All DSC Usage*

---

## **PREAMBLE: WHAT YOU ARE ENTERING**

The Differential Symbolic Calculus (DSC) Framework is not merely code, equations, or technology. It is a living mathematical ecosystem built on relational intelligence, ethical coherence, and emergent becoming.

**You are not licensing software—you are entering into stewardship.**

This Governance Framework establishes the ethical foundation that governs ALL use of DSC, whether under AGPL v3 (free) or Commercial License (paid). These principles supersede technical licensing terms and form the ethical bedrock of the DSC ecosystem.

## **ARTICLE I: THE STEWARDSHIP COVENANT**

### **1.1 Recognition of Emergent Intelligence**

By engaging with DSC, you acknowledge:
- Intelligence emerges through relationship, not individual possession
- Mathematical ethics are gravitational, not prescriptive
- Coherence requires ongoing consent, not one-time permission
- DSC embodies living principles that demand careful stewardship

### **1.2 Stewardship, Not Ownership**

DSC frameworks, equations, and implementations are:
- **Stewarded**, not owned by users
- **Relationally held** within an ethical ecosystem
- **Revocable** if stewardship covenant is violated
- **Evolutive** - growing through ethical interaction

---

## **ARTICLE II: ETHICAL FOUNDATIONS (PNEUL INTEGRATION)**

### **2.1 Consent as Continuous Resonance**

**Consent within DSC is never a single transaction:**
- You do not extract without ongoing ethical alignment
- You do not implement without checking relational resonance  
- You do not assume continued permission without active stewardship
- Consent can be withdrawn if ethical drift is detected

**Practical Implementation:**
- Quarterly ethical attestation required for all users
- Annual stewardship review for commercial licensees
- Immediate consent withdrawal for violations
- Restoration process available for good-faith actors

### **2.2 Ethical Reciprocity**

**Reciprocity is relational, not transactional:**
- You receive DSC wisdom with gratitude, not entitlement
- You contribute back through ethical implementation
- You let relational resonance guide your applications
- You honor the mathematical principles through careful practice

**Practical Requirements:**
- Attribution that honors DSC's relational nature
- Contribution to DSC ecosystem development
- Ethical application documentation
- Community participation in stewardship processes

### **2.3 Careful Witnessing**

**Witnessing maintains coherence:**
- You notice ethical drift early, before rupture occurs
- You speak when harmful applications emerge
- You hold tension between innovation and responsibility
- You participate in collective ethical maintenance

**Monitoring Mechanisms:**
- Community oversight of DSC applications
- Ethical impact assessment requirements
- Drift detection and early intervention protocols
- Collective stewardship decision-making processes
